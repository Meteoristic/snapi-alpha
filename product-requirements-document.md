## 1. Introduction: Defining the Snapi Experience

### 1.1. What Snapi Delivers:
Snapi is an intelligent, AI-powered shopping assistant designed to revolutionize how users discover, compare, and track products across leading U.S. retailers. By interpreting natural language prompts, Snapi demystifies the online shopping journey, delivering curated, budget-conscious, and style-aligned recommendations.

### 1.2. Core Value Proposition:
Snapi's distinct advantage lies in its ability to:
- **Transform Complexity into Clarity:** Convert nuanced, conversational shopping queries into actionable, intelligent product results.
- **Combat Decision Fatigue:** Empower users with AI-driven comparison tools that simplify choices and highlight key differentiators.
- **Enable Seamless Shopping Journeys:** Facilitate a fluid path from discovery to potential purchase through intuitive affiliate redirection, intelligent watchlists, and style-aware recommendations.

### 1.3. MVP Strategic Focus (Problem-Solution Validation):
The modern shopper, particularly within the Gen Z and Millennial demographics, grapples with decision overload, inherent distrust in pervasive advertising, and the challenge of finding products that authentically resonate with their personal style and financial parameters. Snapi's MVP directly addresses this pain point by strategically fusing advanced AI-driven understanding with intuitive product discovery, emergent personalization, and indispensable price tracking capabilities‚Äîall delivered within a singular, minimalist, and highly engaging user experience. Our primary goal is to validate this problem-solution fit.
