# ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Guide for Snapi

## Current Issue
Getting 404 errors on Vercel deployment - this guide will fix them!

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Environment Variables Setup (CRITICAL)
Your app requires API keys to function. In Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Environment Variables** in the sidebar
4. Add these variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GOOGLE_CX_ID=your_google_custom_search_id_here
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key_here
BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your_bing_search_key_here
```

**Note**: At minimum, you MUST set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the app to work.

### 2. Redeploy After Environment Variables
1. After adding environment variables, click **Deployments** tab
2. Find your latest deployment
3. Click the **3 dots menu** â†’ **Redeploy**
4. Check "Use existing Build Cache" and click **Redeploy**

### 3. Check Build Logs
If still getting 404s:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **View Build Logs**
4. Look for any errors in the build process

### 4. Common Fixes

#### A. If getting "OPENAI_API_KEY is required" error:
- Make sure you added the environment variable correctly
- The key should start with `sk-` for OpenAI
- No extra spaces or quotes

#### B. If getting build errors:
The `vercel.json` file should handle most issues, but if needed:
1. Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. Check that TypeScript errors are ignored (already configured)

#### C. If routing issues:
- The app uses Next.js App Router
- Routes should work automatically: `/`, `/search`, `/results`, etc.

### 5. Test URLs After Deployment
Once deployed successfully, test these URLs:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` - Landing page
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/search` - Search page  
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/search` - Should return method not allowed (POST only)

### 6. Debug Mode
If still having issues, temporarily add this environment variable in Vercel:
```
DEBUG=1
```

This will provide more detailed error logs.

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Landing page loads correctly
- Search functionality works
- Real product results from JBL, Adidas, Amazon, etc.
- Response times under 15 seconds

## Need Help?
If you're still getting 404s after following these steps:
1. Check the Vercel build logs for specific error messages
